Varnish Cache Purge Manager
===========================
Provides easy and automatic ability to purge varnish cache for your whole site, section, or a page.  Also adds metabox to override TTL and Disable cache for a specific page/post/cpt.

This requires that you have an existing Varnish setup with RegEx purge capabilities.
